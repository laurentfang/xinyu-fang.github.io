## About Me

I'm a Mechanical Engineering Ph.D. student at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/" target="_blank"> Cornell University</a>'s
<a href="https://www.mae.cornell.edu/mae" target="_blank"> Sibley School of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering</a>,
working under the mentorship of Prof.<a href="https://www.mae.cornell.edu/faculty-directory/silvia-ferrari" target="_blank">
Silvia Ferrari</a>. My research involves developing control policies for Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs, or drones) that 
aim to navigate or plan obstacle free paths, and autonomous driving.
 
Prior to joining the Ph.D. program, I completed my bachelor's degree in Chemical Engineering from The Ohio State University
</a> advised by Prof. <a href= "https://cbe.osu.edu/people/wang.12206" target = "_blank"> Xiaoguang Wang</a>.

Outside of academia, I am a father of a Samoye dog (Coconut) and 8 cats (Issac, Burberry, Jona, Humphrey, Blink, 
Charlotte, Tisha, and Lily). I enjoy driving, off-roading, camping, kayaking, hiking, etc.
